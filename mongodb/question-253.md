## question : What is MongoDB's $week operator?

## answer: $week is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that extracts the week number of the year from a Date object. This operator is useful for performing operations or aggregations based on the week of the year. For example, to extract the week number from a 'date' field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { week: { $week: '$date' } } }]). The $week operator is particularly useful in scenarios where data needs to be grouped or analyzed on a weekly basis, such as generating weekly reports or identifying weekly trends.
