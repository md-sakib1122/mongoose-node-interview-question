## question : What is MongoDB's $slice operator?

## answer: $slice is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that returns a subset of an array by specifying a start position and an optional length. This operator is useful when you need to limit the number of elements in an array field. For example, to get the first 3 elements from an array 'items', you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { firstThreeItems: { $slice: ['$items', 3] } } }]). The $slice operator is particularly useful in scenarios where only a portion of an array is needed, such as when displaying the top N results, paginating data, or extracting specific segments from larger arrays.
