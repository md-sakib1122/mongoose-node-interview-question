## question : What is MongoDB's $cond operator?

## answer: $cond is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that performs a conditional evaluation, similar to an 'if-else' statement in programming. This operator is used to evaluate a condition and return one value if the condition is true, and another value if it is false. For example, to assign a grade based on a score, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { grade: { $cond: { if: { $gte: ['$score', 50] }, then: 'Pass', else: 'Fail' } } } }]). The $cond operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to implement logic-based transformations within your aggregation pipeline, allowing for dynamic field evaluation based on conditions.
