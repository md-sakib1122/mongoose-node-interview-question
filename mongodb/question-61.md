## question : What is the difference between $addToSet and $push in MongoDB?

## answer: In MongoDB, both $addToSet and $push are operators used to add elements to an array field within a document, but they serve different purposes and behave differently. The $push operator adds the specified element to the end of the array, regardless of whether that element already exists in the array. For example, using db.users.updateOne({ _id: userId }, { $push: { tags: 'newTag' } }) adds 'newTag' to the 'tags' array even if 'newTag' is already present. On the other hand, $addToSet adds the element to the array only if it is not already present, ensuring that there are no duplicate values in the array. For example, using db.users.updateOne({ _id: userId }, { $addToSet: { tags: 'newTag' } }) adds 'newTag' only if it is not already in the 'tags' array. If 'newTag' is already present, the operation has no effect. This makes $addToSet particularly useful for maintaining unique lists, such as tags, categories, or IDs. While $push is ideal when you want to add elements unconditionally, $addToSet is the better choice when you need to ensure that an array contains only unique values, preventing duplicates.
