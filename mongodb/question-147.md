## question : What is MongoDB's $tan operator?

## answer: $tan is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that calculates the tangent of a value expressed in radians. It is particularly useful in trigonometric calculations, especially in applications involving geometry, physics, and engineering where angle and slope calculations are essential. For example, to calculate the tangent of the 'angle' field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { tanValue: { $tan: '$angle' } } }]). The $tan operator is crucial for scenarios involving angle-based computations, such as determining the slope of a line, analyzing waveforms, or modeling rotational dynamics.
