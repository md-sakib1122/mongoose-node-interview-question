## question : What is MongoDB's $isoDayOfWeek operator?

## answer: $isoDayOfWeek is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that extracts the ISO-8601 day of the week from a date field, where Monday is 1 and Sunday is 7. This operator is useful for grouping or filtering documents based on the day of the week. For example, to extract the ISO day of the week from a 'createdAt' date field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { isoDayOfWeek: { $isoDayOfWeek: '$createdAt' } } }]). The $isoDayOfWeek operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to analyze data by the specific day of the week according to the ISO standard.
