## question : What is MongoDB's $objectToArray operator?

## answer: $objectToArray is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that converts a document (object) into an array of key-value pairs. This operator is useful when you need to deconstruct an object into an array format for further processing. For example, to convert a document's fields into an array, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { kvArray: { $objectToArray: '$objectField' } } }]). The $objectToArray operator is particularly useful for transforming data structures, enabling you to work with objects in a more flexible array format within MongoDB's aggregation pipelines.
