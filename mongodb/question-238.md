## question : What is MongoDB's $concat operator?

## answer: $concat is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that concatenates two or more strings into a single string. This operator is useful for combining text fields or creating new strings from existing data. For example, to concatenate fields 'firstName' and 'lastName' with a space in between, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { fullName: { $concat: ['$firstName', ' ', '$lastName'] } } }]). The $concat operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to generate full names, formatted addresses, or any combined text outputs from multiple string fields.
