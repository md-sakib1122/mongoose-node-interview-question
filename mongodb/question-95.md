## question : What is the purpose of MongoDB's $unwind operator?

## answer: $unwind is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework used to deconstruct an array field from the input documents, resulting in multiple output documents where each document contains a single element from the array. For example, if a document contains an array of items, $unwind creates a separate document for each item in the array: db.orders.aggregate([{ $unwind: '$items' }]). This operator is particularly useful for breaking down arrays to perform more detailed analysis or aggregation on individual elements. It is commonly used in scenarios where you need to process or analyze elements within an array field in MongoDB.
