## question : What is MongoDB's $month operator?

## answer: $month is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that extracts the month from a Date object. This operator is useful for performing operations or aggregations based on the month of a date. For example, to extract the month from a 'date' field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { month: { $month: '$date' } } }]). The $month operator is particularly useful in scenarios where data needs to be grouped or filtered based on the month, such as generating monthly reports or analyzing monthly trends.
