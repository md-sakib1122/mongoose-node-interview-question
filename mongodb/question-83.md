## question : What is the use of MongoDB's $cond operator?

## answer: $cond is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that allows you to perform conditional logic within an aggregation pipeline. It works similarly to an if-else statement in programming languages, enabling you to return different values based on the evaluation of a condition. The $cond operator takes three arguments: a condition, a value to return if the condition is true, and a value to return if the condition is false. This operator is particularly useful when you need to create computed fields that depend on the values of other fields. For example, if you want to create a new field 'statusLabel' based on the 'status' field, you could use $cond as follows: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { statusLabel: { $cond: { if: { $eq: ['$status', 'active'] }, then: 'Active User', else: 'Inactive User' } } } }]). This aggregation stage adds a 'statusLabel' field that returns 'Active User' if the 'status' field is 'active', and 'Inactive User' otherwise. The $cond operator is a powerful tool for implementing conditional logic directly within your MongoDB aggregations, allowing for more dynamic and flexible data processing.
