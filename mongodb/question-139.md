## question : What is MongoDB's $abs operator?

## answer: $abs is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that returns the absolute value of a numeric expression. This operator is useful when you need to ensure that a number is always positive, regardless of its original sign. For example, to return the absolute value of a 'balance' field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { absoluteBalance: { $abs: '$balance' } } }]). The $abs operator is particularly useful in financial calculations, distance measurements, or any context where only the magnitude of a number matters, regardless of whether it is positive or negative.
