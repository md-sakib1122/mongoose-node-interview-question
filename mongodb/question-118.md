## question : What is MongoDB's $lte operator?

## answer: $lte is a comparison operator in MongoDB that matches documents where the value of a specified field is less than or equal to a given value. It is commonly used in queries to filter documents where a field must be less than or equal to a specific threshold. For example, to find all documents where the 'age' field is less than or equal to 30, you would use: db.collection.find({ age: { $lte: 30 } }). The $lte operator is particularly useful when you need to include documents that meet a specific upper limit, ensuring that all relevant records are captured in the query results.
