## question : What is MongoDB's $lt operator?

## answer: $lt is a comparison operator in MongoDB that matches documents where the value of a specified field is less than a given value. It is commonly used in queries to filter documents based on a condition where a field must be smaller than a specific threshold. For example, to find all documents where the 'age' field is less than 30, you would use: db.collection.find({ age: { $lt: 30 } }). The $lt operator is essential for scenarios where you need to filter results based on numeric or date values, ensuring that only documents meeting the 'less than' criteria are returned.
