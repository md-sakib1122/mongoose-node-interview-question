## question : What is the use of $and in MongoDB?

## answer: The $and operator in MongoDB is used to join multiple query expressions with a logical AND, meaning that only documents that satisfy all the specified conditions will be returned. The $and operator is particularly useful when you need to filter documents based on multiple criteria that must all be true. For example, if you want to find all documents in a collection where the 'status' field is 'active' and the 'age' field is greater than 30, you would use: db.collection.find({ $and: [ { status: 'active' }, { age: { $gt: 30 } } ] }). This query returns only the documents where both conditions are met. Although $and is explicitly used as shown in the example, MongoDB allows implicit AND operations by simply including multiple conditions in a query document without using $and. For instance, the query: db.collection.find({ status: 'active', age: { $gt: 30 } }) achieves the same result. However, $and becomes necessary when combining multiple conditions on the same field or when used with other logical operators like $or or $not. Understanding how to use $and effectively is crucial for building complex queries that precisely filter the data you need from your MongoDB collections.
