## question : What is MongoDB's $strLenCP operator?

## answer: $strLenCP is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that returns the number of code points in a string. Unlike $strLenBytes, which counts bytes, $strLenCP counts Unicode code points, which is useful for accurately measuring string lengths in multilingual contexts. For example, to get the length of a string field 'name' in code points, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { nameLength: { $strLenCP: '$name' } } }]). The $strLenCP operator is particularly useful in scenarios where accurate string length measurements are needed, such as for text processing and handling multi-byte characters.
