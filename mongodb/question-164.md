## question : What is MongoDB's $toInt operator?

## answer: $toInt is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that converts a specified value to an integer. This operator is useful when you need to ensure that a value is in integer format for calculations or comparisons. For example, to convert a string field 'quantity' to an integer, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { quantityInt: { $toInt: '$quantity' } } }]). The $toInt operator is particularly useful in scenarios where numeric calculations or comparisons are required, ensuring that non-integer inputs are correctly interpreted as integers in your MongoDB queries and operations.
