## question : What is MongoDB's $mergeObjects operator?

## answer: $mergeObjects is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that merges multiple documents or subdocuments into a single document. It combines fields from different documents, with fields from later documents overwriting those from earlier ones in case of conflicts. For example, to merge two fields 'details1' and 'details2' into a single document, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { mergedDetails: { $mergeObjects: ['$details1', '$details2'] } } }]). The $mergeObjects operator is particularly useful for consolidating data from various sources or stages in your aggregation pipeline, ensuring that the final document contains comprehensive and up-to-date information.
