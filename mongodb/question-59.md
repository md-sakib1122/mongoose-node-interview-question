## question : What is the use of $slice in MongoDB?

## answer: $slice is an operator in MongoDB that is used with the $push operator in update operations or in projection to limit the number of elements returned in an array field. When used with $push, $slice helps control the size of the array by truncating it to a specified length after new elements are added. This is particularly useful when you want to maintain a capped list within a document, such as keeping only the most recent 10 messages in a chat history. For example, to add a new message to an array and keep only the last 10 messages, you would use: db.chats.updateOne({ _id: chatId }, { $push: { messages: { $each: [newMessage], $slice: -10 } } }). Here, the $slice: -10 ensures that only the last 10 elements remain in the 'messages' array. When used in projection, $slice allows you to return only a portion of an array field in the query results. For instance, to retrieve just the first 3 items from an array, you would use: db.posts.find({}, { comments: { $slice: 3 } }). The $slice operator is a versatile tool for managing array fields in MongoDB, enabling you to control and optimize the data returned or stored.
