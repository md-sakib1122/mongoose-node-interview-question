## question : What is MongoDB's $toDouble operator?

## answer: $toDouble is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that converts a specified value to a double (floating-point number). This operator is useful when you need to ensure that a value is in double format for calculations that require decimal precision. For example, to convert a string field 'price' to a double, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { priceDouble: { $toDouble: '$price' } } }]). The $toDouble operator is particularly useful in financial calculations, scientific computations, or any scenario where decimal precision is required, ensuring that inputs are correctly interpreted as double values.
