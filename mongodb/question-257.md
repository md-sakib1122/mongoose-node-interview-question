## question : What is MongoDB's $count operator?

## answer: $count is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that counts the number of documents that pass a given stage of the pipeline. It is useful for aggregating and summarizing data. For example, to count the number of documents in a collection, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $count: 'totalCount' }]). The $count operator provides a simple way to get aggregate counts and is commonly used in reporting and analysis to summarize data based on specific criteria or filters.
