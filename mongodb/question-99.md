## question : What is the purpose of MongoDB's $count operator?

## answer: $count is a stage in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that returns the total number of documents that pass through the pipeline. It is commonly used to determine the size of a result set after applying various filters or transformations. For example, to count the number of documents in a collection where the 'status' is 'active', you would use: db.users.aggregate([{ $match: { status: 'active' } }, { $count: 'totalActiveUsers' }]). The $count operator is essential for summarizing the results of an aggregation, providing a simple way to determine the number of documents that meet specific criteria.
