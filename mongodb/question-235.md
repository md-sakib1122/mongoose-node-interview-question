## question : What is MongoDB's $toUpper operator?

## answer: $toUpper is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that converts a string field to uppercase. This operator is useful for normalizing text data for case-insensitive comparisons or searches. For example, to convert a field 'name' to uppercase, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { upperName: { $toUpper: '$name' } } }]). The $toUpper operator is particularly useful in scenarios where text data needs to be standardized for consistent processing, such as when performing case-insensitive searches or ensuring uniform text formatting.
