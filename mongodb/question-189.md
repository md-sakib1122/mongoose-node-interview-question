## question : What is MongoDB's $dateAdd operator?

## answer: $dateAdd is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that adds a specified amount of time to a date, returning the new date. It is useful for calculating future dates based on a given date, such as adding days, months, or years. For example, to add 30 days to a 'createdAt' date field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { futureDate: { $dateAdd: { startDate: '$createdAt', unit: 'day', amount: 30 } } } }]). The $dateAdd operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to calculate due dates, expiration dates, or forecast future events based on current or past dates.
