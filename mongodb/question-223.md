## question : What is MongoDB's $set operator?

## answer: $set is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that adds new fields to documents or updates existing fields. It is a more flexible replacement for the $project operator when you need to add or modify fields without affecting the entire document structure. For example, to add a field 'status' with a value 'active', you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $set: { status: 'active' } }]). The $set operator is particularly useful for enriching documents with additional information, performing calculations, or updating fields based on new criteria.
