## question : What is MongoDB's $isNumber operator?

## answer: $isNumber is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that checks if a specified value is a number. It returns a boolean result indicating whether the value is numeric. This operator is useful for validating data types or filtering documents based on numeric fields. For example, to check if the 'age' field is a number, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { isNumeric: { $isNumber: '$age' } } }]). The $isNumber operator is particularly useful in scenarios where data type consistency is important, such as in data validation, processing, or ensuring that calculations are performed on numeric fields.
