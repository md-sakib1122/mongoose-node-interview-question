## question : What is the difference between MongoDB's $eq and $ne operators?

## answer: In MongoDB, $eq and $ne are comparison operators used to filter documents based on whether a field's value is equal to or not equal to a specified value, respectively. The $eq operator matches documents where the value of a field is exactly equal to the specified value. For example, to find documents where the 'status' field is 'active', you would use: db.collection.find({ status: { $eq: 'active' } }). This query returns all documents where the 'status' field is 'active'. On the other hand, the $ne operator matches documents where the value of a field is not equal to the specified value. For example, to find documents where the 'status' field is not 'active', you would use: db.collection.find({ status: { $ne: 'active' } }). This query returns all documents where the 'status' field is anything other than 'active'. While $eq is used to include documents with a specific value, $ne is used to exclude them, making these operators essential for precise filtering in MongoDB queries. Understanding when to use $eq and $ne is crucial for constructing queries that return the desired subset of documents based on equality or inequality conditions.
