## question : What is MongoDB's $regexMatch operator?

## answer: $regexMatch is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that checks if a string field matches a specified regular expression and returns a boolean result (true or false). This operator is useful for validating or filtering documents based on text patterns. For example, to check if a 'description' field contains any digit sequences, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { hasDigits: { $regexMatch: { input: '$description', regex: '\d+' } } } }]). The $regexMatch operator is essential in scenarios where you need to perform pattern matching within strings, such as input validation, search functionality, or data cleaning.
