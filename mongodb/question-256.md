## question : What is MongoDB's $replaceRoot operator?

## answer: $replaceRoot is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that replaces the input document with a specified document, allowing you to restructure or reshape documents within the pipeline. For example, to replace the root document with a nested field 'details', you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $replaceRoot: { newRoot: '$details' } }]). The $replaceRoot operator is particularly useful for simplifying the document structure or for transforming nested fields into the top-level document.
