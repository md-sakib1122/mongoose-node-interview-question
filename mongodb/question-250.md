## question : What is MongoDB's $hour operator?

## answer: $hour is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that extracts the hour from a Date object. This operator is useful for performing operations or aggregations based on the hour of a date. For example, to extract the hour from a 'timestamp' field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { hour: { $hour: '$timestamp' } } }]). The $hour operator is particularly useful in scenarios where time-based data needs to be analyzed or reported on an hourly basis, such as tracking peak usage times or generating hourly statistics.
