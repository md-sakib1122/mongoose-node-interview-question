## question : What is MongoDB's $ceil operator?

## answer: $ceil is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that rounds a numeric value up to the nearest integer. It is useful in scenarios where you need to ensure that a number is always rounded up. For example, to round up a 'price' field to the nearest whole number, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { roundedUpPrice: { $ceil: '$price' } } }]). The $ceil operator is particularly useful for financial calculations, billing, or any context where fractional values should be rounded up to the next whole number.
