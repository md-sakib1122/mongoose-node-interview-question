## question : What is MongoDB's $month operator?

## answer: $month is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that extracts the month from a date field, returning an integer between 1 and 12. This operator is useful for grouping or filtering documents by month. For example, to extract the month from a 'createdAt' date field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { month: { $month: '$createdAt' } } }]). The $month operator is particularly useful in scenarios involving monthly analysis, such as generating monthly reports, identifying seasonal trends, or when working with time series data that requires grouping by month.
