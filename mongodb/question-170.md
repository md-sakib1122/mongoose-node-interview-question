## question : What is MongoDB's $week operator?

## answer: $week is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that extracts the week number from a date field. The week number is calculated according to the ISO-8601 standard, where the first week of the year is the one containing the first Thursday. This operator is useful for grouping or filtering documents by week. For example, to extract the week number from a 'createdAt' date field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { weekNumber: { $week: '$createdAt' } } }]). The $week operator is particularly useful in scenarios involving time-based analysis, such as weekly reporting or time series data aggregation.
