## question : What is the use of $group in MongoDB Aggregation?

## answer: $group is a stage in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that is used to group documents by a specified key and perform aggregate operations on the grouped data, such as calculating sums, averages, counts, and other summary statistics. The $group stage is similar to the GROUP BY clause in SQL and is a powerful tool for summarizing and transforming data within MongoDB. When using $group, you define a _id field to specify the grouping key. This key can be a single field, an expression, or a combination of fields. All documents that share the same value for the _id key are grouped together, and aggregate operations are performed on the grouped documents. For example, to group documents by the 'category' field and calculate the total sales for each category, you would use the following $group stage: { $group: { _id: '$category', totalSales: { $sum: '$sales' } } }. This stage groups the documents by category and calculates the sum of the 'sales' field for each category, storing the result in a new field called 'totalSales'. The $group stage supports a variety of aggregation operators, including $sum, $avg, $min, $max, $push, $addToSet, and $first, among others. These operators allow you to perform a wide range of calculations and transformations on the grouped data. For example, you can use $avg to calculate the average value of a field, $min and $max to find the minimum and maximum values, and $push to create an array of values from the grouped documents. The $group stage is highly versatile and can be used in combination with other stages in the aggregation pipeline to create complex data transformations. For example, you might use $match to filter documents before grouping, $sort to order the grouped results, or $project to reshape the output documents. In addition to simple grouping, $group can also be used to group documents by computed values or expressions. For example, you can group documents by the result of an arithmetic expression, such as grouping by the year of a date field using the $year operator: { $group: { _id: { year: { $year: '$date' } }, totalSales: { $sum: '$sales' } } }. This groups the documents by the year extracted from the 'date' field and calculates the total sales for each year. Another advanced use case for $group is when you need to perform multiple aggregate operations within a single $group stage. For example, you can calculate both the total sales and the average sales for each category in a single $group stage: { $group: { _id: '$category', totalSales: { $sum: '$sales' }, avgSales: { $avg: '$sales' } } }. This stage groups the documents by category and calculates both the sum and average of the 'sales' field for each category. In summary, the $group stage in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework is a powerful and flexible tool for grouping and aggregating data, enabling you to perform complex data transformations and calculations within your MongoDB queries.
