## question : What is MongoDB's $reduce operator?

## answer: $reduce is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that applies a specified expression to each element of an array and accumulates the results into a single value. It is useful for aggregating or summarizing data within arrays. For example, to calculate the sum of values in an 'amounts' array, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { totalAmount: { $reduce: { input: '$amounts', initialValue: 0, in: { $add: ['$$value', '$$this'] } } } } }]). The $reduce operator is particularly useful for performing aggregations or transformations on array elements.
