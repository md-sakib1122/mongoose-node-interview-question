## question : What is MongoDB's $dateToParts operator?

## answer: $dateToParts is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that extracts individual components (year, month, day, hour, minute, etc.) from a BSON Date object and returns them as a document. This operator is useful when you need to break down a date into its constituent parts for analysis or formatting. For example, to extract the year, month, and day from a 'createdAt' date field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { dateParts: { $dateToParts: { date: '$createdAt' } } } }]). The $dateToParts operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to work with specific components of a date, such as in time series analysis, scheduling applications, or when preparing data for display or reporting.
