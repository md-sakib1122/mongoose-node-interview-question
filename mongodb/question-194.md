## question : What is MongoDB's $map operator?

## answer: $map is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that applies a specified expression to each element of an array and returns a new array with the results. It is particularly useful for transforming array elements or performing calculations on each element in an array. For example, to add 10 to each element in a 'scores' array, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { adjustedScores: { $map: { input: '$scores', as: 'score', in: { $add: ['$$score', 10] } } } } }]). The $map operator is essential in scenarios where you need to manipulate arrays, such as applying mathematical operations, formatting data, or generating new arrays based on existing ones.
