## question : What is MongoDB's $hour operator?

## answer: $hour is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that extracts the hour from a date field, returning an integer between 0 and 23. This operator is useful for grouping or filtering documents by the hour of the day. For example, to extract the hour from a 'createdAt' date field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { hour: { $hour: '$createdAt' } } }]). The $hour operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to analyze data based on the specific hour of the day, such as in hourly traffic analysis, real-time monitoring, or when examining time-based patterns within a 24-hour period.
