## question : What is MongoDB's $log10 operator?

## answer: $log10 is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that calculates the base-10 logarithm of a number. It is particularly useful in scenarios involving logarithmic scales, such as decibel calculations, pH measurements, or financial analysis where understanding the order of magnitude is important. For example, to calculate the base-10 logarithm of the 'value' field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { log10Value: { $log10: '$value' } } }]). The $log10 operator simplifies the process of applying logarithmic transformations to data, making it easier to analyze and interpret large ranges of values in a more manageable scale.
