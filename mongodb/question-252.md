## question : What is MongoDB's $second operator?

## answer: $second is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that extracts the second from a Date object. This operator is useful for performing operations or aggregations based on the second of a date. For example, to extract the second from a 'timestamp' field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { second: { $second: '$timestamp' } } }]). The $second operator is particularly useful in scenarios where precise time-based data analysis is required, such as in real-time monitoring or detailed time-based reporting.
