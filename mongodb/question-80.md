## question : What is MongoDB's $addToSet operator?

## answer: $addToSet is an operator in MongoDB used in update operations to add an element to an array field, but only if the element does not already exist in the array. This operator is particularly useful for maintaining unique lists, such as tags, categories, or user roles, where you want to ensure that no duplicates are added. For example, to add a tag to a document's 'tags' array only if it is not already present, you would use: db.posts.updateOne({ _id: postId }, { $addToSet: { tags: 'mongodb' } }). If 'mongodb' is already in the 'tags' array, the operation has no effect; if it is not present, 'mongodb' is added. The $addToSet operator can also be used with the $each modifier to add multiple unique elements at once. For example, db.posts.updateOne({ _id: postId }, { $addToSet: { tags: { $each: ['mongodb', 'database'] } } }) ensures that both 'mongodb' and 'database' are added only if they are not already in the array. Unlike the $push operator, which adds elements unconditionally, $addToSet guarantees that the array will only contain unique values, making it a powerful tool for managing data integrity in MongoDB.
