## question : What is MongoDB's $merge operator?

## answer: $merge is a stage in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that writes the results of an aggregation pipeline to a specified collection. It can either create a new collection or merge the results into an existing collection by updating or inserting documents as needed. For example, to aggregate data and write the results to a new collection, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $group: { _id: '$category', total: { $sum: '$amount' } } }, { $merge: { into: 'categoryTotals' } }]). $merge is useful for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations, where the output of an aggregation needs to be saved for further use. It provides a powerful way to materialize aggregated results directly within MongoDB.
