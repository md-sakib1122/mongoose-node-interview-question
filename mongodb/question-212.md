## question : What is MongoDB's $concatArrays operator?

## answer: $concatArrays is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that concatenates two or more arrays into a single array. This operator is useful when you need to combine elements from multiple arrays within a document. For example, to concatenate two arrays 'array1' and 'array2', you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { combinedArray: { $concatArrays: ['$array1', '$array2'] } } }]). The $concatArrays operator is particularly useful in scenarios where data is distributed across multiple arrays and needs to be merged into a single array for further processing or analysis.
