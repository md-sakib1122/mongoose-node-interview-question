## question : What is MongoDB's $regexFind operator?

## answer: $regexFind is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that searches a string field for a match against a specified regular expression and returns information about the first match found. This operator is useful for extracting specific patterns from text data. For example, to find the first occurrence of a digit sequence in a 'description' field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { firstMatch: { $regexFind: { input: '$description', regex: '\d+' } } } }]). The $regexFind operator is essential in scenarios where you need to identify and extract patterns within text, such as validating formats or parsing data.
