## question : What is MongoDB's $isObject operator?

## answer: $isObject is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that checks if a specified value is an object. It returns a boolean result indicating whether the value is an object. This operator is useful for validating data structures or filtering documents based on object fields. For example, to check if the 'details' field is an object, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { isObject: { $isObject: '$details' } } }]). The $isObject operator is particularly useful in scenarios where data structure consistency is important, such as in data validation, processing, or ensuring that operations are performed on object fields.
