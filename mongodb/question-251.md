## question : What is MongoDB's $minute operator?

## answer: $minute is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that extracts the minute from a Date object. This operator is useful for performing operations or aggregations based on the minute of a date. For example, to extract the minute from a 'timestamp' field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { minute: { $minute: '$timestamp' } } }]). The $minute operator is particularly useful in scenarios where data needs to be analyzed or reported on a minute-by-minute basis, such as monitoring real-time data or generating minute-based reports.
