## question : What is MongoDB's $toInt operator?

## answer: $toInt is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that converts a value to an integer. This is useful for converting data types when performing arithmetic operations or comparisons. For example, to convert a string field 'price' to an integer, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { priceInt: { $toInt: '$price' } } }]). The $toInt operator is particularly useful when dealing with data stored in various formats and ensuring that numeric operations are performed correctly.
