## question : What is MongoDB's $dateFromString operator?

## answer: $dateFromString is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that converts a date/time string into a BSON Date object based on a specified format. This operator is useful for converting string representations of dates into a date type for further date-based operations. For example, to convert a string field 'dateStr' formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD' into a Date object, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { date: { $dateFromString: { dateString: '$dateStr', format: '%Y-%m-%d' } } } }]). The $dateFromString operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to parse and standardize date strings from various formats into MongoDB's native date format for accurate querying and analysis.
