## question : What is the difference between MongoDB's $in and $nin operators?

## answer: In MongoDB, $in and $nin are comparison operators used to filter documents based on whether a field's value matches or does not match any value in a specified array, respectively. The $in operator selects documents where the value of a field matches any of the values in the provided array. For example, to find users whose role is either 'admin' or 'moderator', you would use: db.users.find({ role: { $in: ['admin', 'moderator'] } }). This query returns all documents where the 'role' field is 'admin' or 'moderator'. Conversely, the $nin operator selects documents where the value of a field does not match any of the values in the provided array. Using the same example, to find users whose role is neither 'admin' nor 'moderator', you would use: db.users.find({ role: { $nin: ['admin', 'moderator'] } }). This query returns all documents where the 'role' field is not 'admin' or 'moderator'. While $in is used to include specific values, $nin is used to exclude them. These operators are essential for filtering documents based on a set of criteria, allowing you to include or exclude specific values in your MongoDB queries.
