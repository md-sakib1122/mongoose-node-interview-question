## question : What is MongoDB's $toLower operator?

## answer: $toLower is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that converts a string field to lowercase. This operator is useful for normalizing text data for case-insensitive comparisons or searches. For example, to convert a field 'title' to lowercase, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { lowerTitle: { $toLower: '$title' } } }]). The $toLower operator is particularly useful in scenarios where text data needs to be standardized for consistent processing, such as when performing case-insensitive searches or aggregating text data.
