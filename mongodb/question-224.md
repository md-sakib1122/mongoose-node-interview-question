## question : What is MongoDB's $arrayElemAt operator?

## answer: $arrayElemAt is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that retrieves the element at a specified index from an array. This operator is useful when you need to access a particular element within an array based on its position. For example, to retrieve the element at index 2 from an array 'items', you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { itemAtIndex: { $arrayElemAt: ['$items', 2] } } }]). The $arrayElemAt operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to extract specific elements from arrays for further processing or analysis.
