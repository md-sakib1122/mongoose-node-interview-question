## question : What is MongoDB's $dateAdd operator?

## answer: $dateAdd is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that adds a specified time duration to a date field, returning the resulting date. This operator is useful for performing date arithmetic, such as calculating future or past dates based on a given interval. For example, to add 7 days to a 'createdAt' date field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { futureDate: { $dateAdd: { startDate: '$createdAt', unit: 'day', amount: 7 } } } }]). The $dateAdd operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to calculate deadlines, expiration dates, or schedule future events.
