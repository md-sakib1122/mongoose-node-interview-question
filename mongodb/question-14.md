## question : What is a capped collection in MongoDB?

## answer: A capped collection in MongoDB is a special type of collection that has a fixed size, and when that size limit is reached, the oldest documents are automatically removed to make room for new documents. This behavior is similar to a circular buffer or a log file, where data is continuously written and old data is discarded as new data comes in. Capped collections are particularly useful for scenarios where you need to maintain a fixed-size dataset, such as logs, event streams, or caches, where only the most recent data is of interest. The key characteristics of a capped collection are its fixed size and the fact that documents are stored in insertion order. Once the collection reaches its size limit, MongoDB automatically overwrites the oldest documents with the new ones. This ensures that the collection remains within its predefined size limit, both in terms of disk space and the number of documents. To create a capped collection, you use the createCollection() method and specify the size option. For example: db.createCollection('myCappedCollection', {capped: true, size: 100000}). This creates a capped collection with a maximum size of 100,000 bytes. You can also specify the maximum number of documents using the max option, but the size limit takes precedence if both are specified. One of the advantages of capped collections is their performance. Since the size of the collection is fixed, MongoDB can allocate space for the collection in advance, which reduces the need for dynamic allocation and file system fragmentation. Additionally, operations on capped collections are more efficient because MongoDB can quickly locate the next available space for inserting documents. Another important feature of capped collections is that they support high-throughput operations with predictable performance. This makes them ideal for use cases where data is generated at a high rate and needs to be stored and processed in a timely manner. However, capped collections also come with some limitations. They do not support document deletion (except for the oldest documents when the size limit is reached), and documents cannot be updated if the update would increase the document's size. This is because the size of the capped collection is strictly managed, and increasing the size of documents would violate the collection's size constraints. Additionally, documents in a capped collection must be inserted in the natural order, meaning they are stored in the order they were inserted, and this order cannot be changed. In summary, capped collections in MongoDB provide a useful mechanism for managing fixed-size datasets with predictable performance, making them well-suited for use cases like logging, monitoring, and caching, where only the most recent data is relevant.
