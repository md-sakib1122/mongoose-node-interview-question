## question : What is MongoDB's $dateFromParts operator?

## answer: $dateFromParts is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that constructs a BSON Date object from individual date and time parts, such as year, month, day, hour, minute, and second. This operator is useful for building dates from component values stored in separate fields. For example, to create a date from separate 'year', 'month', and 'day' fields, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { date: { $dateFromParts: { year: '$year', month: '$month', day: '$day' } } } }]). The $dateFromParts operator is particularly useful in scenarios where date components are stored separately and need to be combined into a single Date object for further processing or analysis.
