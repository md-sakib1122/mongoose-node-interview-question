## question : What is MongoDB's $zip operator?

## answer: $zip is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that merges corresponding elements from two or more arrays into a new array of subarrays. This operator is useful when you need to combine related data from multiple arrays. For example, to combine two arrays 'array1' and 'array2', you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { combined: { $zip: { inputs: ['$array1', '$array2'] } } } }]). The $zip operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to pair or merge data from different sources within the same document, such as combining related values or aligning parallel datasets.
