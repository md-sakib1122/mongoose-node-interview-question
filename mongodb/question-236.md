## question : What is MongoDB's $substrBytes operator?

## answer: $substrBytes is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that extracts a substring from a string field based on byte positions. Unlike $substr, which uses character positions, $substrBytes operates on the byte level, which is important for handling binary data or strings in different encodings. For example, to extract a substring starting at byte position 10 with a length of 5 bytes from a field 'data', you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { partialData: { $substrBytes: ['$data', 10, 5] } } }]). The $substrBytes operator is particularly useful in scenarios where precise control over byte positions is needed, such as when working with non-UTF8 encoded strings or binary data.
