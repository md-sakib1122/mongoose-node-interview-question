## question : What is a write concern in MongoDB?

## answer: Write concern in MongoDB is a setting that specifies the level of acknowledgment requested from MongoDB when a write operation (insert, update, delete) is performed. Write concern allows you to control the trade-off between performance and durability in your MongoDB operations. MongoDB offers several levels of write concern: 'w: 1' means the write operation is acknowledged by the primary node only; 'w: 0' means no acknowledgment is required, making the operation asynchronous; 'w: majority' ensures that the write is acknowledged by the majority of replica set members, providing higher durability at the cost of performance. You can also specify a write concern that waits for replication to a specific number of nodes, or include an 'fsync' or 'j' option to ensure the write is flushed to disk. For example, to ensure a write operation is acknowledged by the majority of the replica set, you would use: db.collection.insertOne(document, { writeConcern: { w: 'majority' } }). Write concern is crucial for applications where data durability is critical, such as financial transactions or critical logging, but it can be adjusted for less critical operations where performance is more important than immediate data persistence.
