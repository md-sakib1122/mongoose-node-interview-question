## question : What is MongoDB's $addFields operator?

## answer: $addFields is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that adds new fields to documents or updates existing fields. This operator is useful for enriching documents with additional data or computed fields. For example, to add a field 'fullName' by concatenating 'firstName' and 'lastName', you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $addFields: { fullName: { $concat: ['$firstName', ' ', '$lastName'] } } }]). The $addFields operator is particularly useful for augmenting documents with calculated or derived fields in an aggregation pipeline.
