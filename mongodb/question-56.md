## question : What is a primary key in MongoDB?

## answer: In MongoDB, the primary key is the _id field, which serves as the unique identifier for each document in a collection. Every document in a MongoDB collection must have an _id field, and the value of this field must be unique within the collection. MongoDB automatically creates an index on the _id field, ensuring efficient retrieval of documents based on their primary key. By default, if you do not explicitly set the _id field when inserting a document, MongoDB will generate an ObjectId value for this field. An ObjectId is a 12-byte identifier that includes a timestamp, machine identifier, process identifier, and a counter, making it globally unique across distributed systems. The _id field can store any BSON data type, and you can assign custom values to it, such as a string or an integer, as long as it remains unique. The primary key is crucial in MongoDB for maintaining the uniqueness and identity of documents within a collection, and it plays a central role in operations such as updates, deletes, and queries. Since the _id field is automatically indexed, queries that filter on this field are highly efficient, making it an essential component of MongoDB's data model.
