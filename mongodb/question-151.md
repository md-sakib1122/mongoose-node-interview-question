## question : What is MongoDB's $atan2 operator?

## answer: $atan2 is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that calculates the arctangent of the quotient of its two arguments, usually representing the coordinates of a point. It returns the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (y, x). For example, to calculate the arctangent of the coordinates 'y' and 'x', you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { angle: { $atan2: ['$y', '$x'] } } }]). The $atan2 operator is essential in scenarios involving polar coordinates, determining the angle between vectors, or when working with direction-based calculations in physics and engineering.
