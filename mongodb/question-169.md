## question : What is MongoDB's $convert operator?

## answer: $convert is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that converts a value to a specified type, providing flexibility in data type conversions. It supports converting to types such as string, int, double, decimal, date, and ObjectId. For example, to convert a string field 'amount' to a double, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { amountDouble: { $convert: { input: '$amount', to: 'double' } } } }]). The $convert operator is useful when you need to handle data in various formats and ensure that values are in the correct type for processing, calculations, or storage within MongoDB.
