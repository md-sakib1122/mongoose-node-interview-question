## question : What is MongoDB's $dateSubtract operator?

## answer: $dateSubtract is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that subtracts a specified time duration from a date field, returning the resulting date. This operator is useful for performing date arithmetic, such as calculating past dates based on a given interval. For example, to subtract 30 days from a 'createdAt' date field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { pastDate: { $dateSubtract: { startDate: '$createdAt', unit: 'day', amount: 30 } } } }]). The $dateSubtract operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to calculate time intervals, past events, or age from a specific date.
