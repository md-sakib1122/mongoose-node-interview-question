## question : What is MongoDB's $strcasecmp operator?

## answer: $strcasecmp is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that performs a case-insensitive comparison of two strings. It returns 0 if the strings are equal, -1 if the first string is less than the second, and 1 if it is greater. For example, to compare two fields 'name1' and 'name2' case-insensitively, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { comparisonResult: { $strcasecmp: ['$name1', '$name2'] } } }]). The $strcasecmp operator is particularly useful in scenarios where case-insensitive text matching is required, such as when normalizing user inputs or implementing search functionality.
