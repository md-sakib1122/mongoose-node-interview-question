## question : What is MongoDB's $toDate operator?

## answer: $toDate is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that converts a value to a date type. It is particularly useful when you need to convert strings, integers, or other types to dates for further date-based operations, such as sorting or filtering by time. For example, to convert a string field 'createdAt' to a date, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $addFields: { createdAtDate: { $toDate: '$createdAt' } } }]). The $toDate operator is essential for ensuring that date fields are correctly typed, allowing you to leverage MongoDB's rich set of date functions and operations.
