## question : What is MongoDB's $minute operator?

## answer: $minute is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that extracts the minute from a date field, returning an integer between 0 and 59. This operator is useful for grouping or filtering documents by the minute within an hour. For example, to extract the minute from a 'createdAt' date field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { minute: { $minute: '$createdAt' } } }]). The $minute operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to analyze data based on the specific minute of an hour, such as in minute-by-minute analysis, real-time monitoring, or when examining finer time-based patterns within an hour.
