## question : What is MongoDB's $isArray operator?

## answer: $isArray is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that checks if a specified value is an array. It returns a boolean result indicating whether the value is an array. This operator is useful for validating data structures or filtering documents based on array fields. For example, to check if the 'tags' field is an array, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { isArray: { $isArray: '$tags' } } }]). The $isArray operator is particularly useful in scenarios where data structure consistency is important, such as in data validation, processing, or ensuring that operations are performed on array fields.
