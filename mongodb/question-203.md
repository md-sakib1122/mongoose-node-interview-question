## question : What is MongoDB's $switch operator?

## answer: $switch is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that evaluates multiple conditions and returns a corresponding value for the first condition that evaluates to true. It is similar to a switch-case statement in programming. For example, to categorize scores into grades, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { grade: { $switch: { branches: [{ case: { $gte: ['$score', 90] }, then: 'A' }, { case: { $gte: ['$score', 80] }, then: 'B' }], default: 'F' } } } }]). The $switch operator is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple conditions need to be evaluated, and different outcomes are required based on the conditions met.
