## question : What is MongoDB's $sqrt operator?

## answer: $sqrt is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that calculates the square root of a numeric value. It is useful in various mathematical and statistical calculations, such as computing the distance between points, standard deviations, or geometric means. For example, to calculate the square root of the 'value' field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { sqrtValue: { $sqrt: '$value' } } }]). The $sqrt operator is essential for scenarios where you need to derive the square root of a number, especially in scientific, engineering, or financial contexts.
