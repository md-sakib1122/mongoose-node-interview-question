## question : What is MongoDB's $dayOfMonth operator?

## answer: $dayOfMonth is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that extracts the day of the month from a Date object. This operator is useful for performing operations or aggregations based on the day of the month. For example, to extract the day of the month from a 'date' field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { day: { $dayOfMonth: '$date' } } }]). The $dayOfMonth operator is particularly useful in scenarios where data needs to be grouped or filtered based on the day of the month, such as for daily reports or trend analysis.
