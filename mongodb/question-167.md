## question : What is MongoDB's $toString operator?

## answer: $toString is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that converts a specified value to a string. This operator is useful when you need to ensure that a value is in string format for text processing, comparison, or concatenation. For example, to convert an integer field 'orderId' to a string, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { orderIdString: { $toString: '$orderId' } } }]). The $toString operator is particularly useful in scenarios where data needs to be formatted as text, enabling string-specific operations and ensuring consistency in how data is represented and processed.
