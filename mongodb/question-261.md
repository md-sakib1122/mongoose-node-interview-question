## question : What is MongoDB's $bucketAuto operator?

## answer: $bucketAuto is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that automatically creates buckets of approximately equal size based on a specified field. It is useful for dynamically grouping data into ranges without predefined boundaries. For example, to create automatic buckets for a 'price' field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $bucketAuto: { groupBy: '$price', buckets: 5, output: { count: { $sum: 1 } } } }]). The $bucketAuto operator is particularly useful for analyzing and visualizing data distributions when the exact range boundaries are not known in advance.
