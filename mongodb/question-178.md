## question : What is MongoDB's $second operator?

## answer: $second is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that extracts the second from a date field, returning an integer between 0 and 59. This operator is useful for grouping or filtering documents by the second within a minute. For example, to extract the second from a 'createdAt' date field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { second: { $second: '$createdAt' } } }]). The $second operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to analyze data based on the specific second within a minute, such as in second-by-second analysis, precise time measurements, or when examining real-time data with high temporal resolution.
