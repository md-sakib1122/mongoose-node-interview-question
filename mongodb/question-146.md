## question : What is MongoDB's $cos operator?

## answer: $cos is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that calculates the cosine of a value expressed in radians. It is widely used in trigonometric calculations, particularly in fields like physics, engineering, and computer graphics where angle measurements are critical. For example, to calculate the cosine of the 'angle' field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { cosValue: { $cos: '$angle' } } }]). The $cos operator is essential for scenarios where you need to compute the cosine of an angle, such as in waveform analysis, circular motion calculations, or determining the horizontal component of a vector.
