## question : What is MongoDB's $objectToArray operator?

## answer: $objectToArray is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that converts a document (object) into an array of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair in the array is represented as a document with 'k' and 'v' fields, where 'k' is the key and 'v' is the value. This operator is useful for transforming objects into arrays for easier manipulation or processing. For example, to convert a document field 'details' into an array of key-value pairs, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { detailsArray: { $objectToArray: '$details' } } }]). The $objectToArray operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to perform array-based operations on data that is originally stored as a document.
