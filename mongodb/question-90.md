## question : What is the use of MongoDB's $pull operator?

## answer: $pull is an operator in MongoDB used to remove all instances of a value or values from an array that match a specified condition. This operator is useful when you need to clean up arrays within documents by removing specific elements based on certain criteria. For example, if you want to remove a specific tag from an array of tags, you would use: db.posts.updateOne({ _id: postId }, { $pull: { tags: 'unwantedTag' } }). The $pull operator can also be used with more complex conditions, such as removing all elements from an array that meet a particular condition (e.g., removing all scores below 50). By using $pull, you can efficiently manage and update arrays in your MongoDB documents, ensuring that only relevant or desired elements remain.
