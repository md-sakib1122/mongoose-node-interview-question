## question : What is MongoDB's $dateDiff operator?

## answer: $dateDiff is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that calculates the difference between two dates and returns the result in a specified unit (e.g., years, months, days, hours). This operator is useful for determining the duration between two dates, such as calculating age, tenure, or the time elapsed between events. For example, to calculate the difference in days between 'startDate' and 'endDate', you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { duration: { $dateDiff: { startDate: '$startDate', endDate: '$endDate', unit: 'day' } } } }]). The $dateDiff operator is particularly useful in scenarios where time intervals need to be measured, analyzed, or reported, such as in project management, financial analysis, or tracking time-based metrics.
