## question : What is MongoDB's $bucket operator?

## answer: $bucket is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that categorizes documents into discrete ranges, or 'buckets', based on a specified field. It is useful for histogram-like grouping and summarizing data. For example, to bucket documents by age into ranges, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $bucket: { groupBy: '$age', boundaries: [0, 18, 35, 50, 100], default: 'Other', output: { count: { $sum: 1 } } } }]). The $bucket operator is particularly useful for creating grouped summaries and analyzing data distributions across defined ranges.
