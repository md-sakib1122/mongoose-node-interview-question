## question : What is the purpose of MongoDB's $out operator?

## answer: $out is a stage in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that directs the output of an aggregation pipeline into a specified collection. This operator is typically used at the end of an aggregation pipeline to write the results to a new or existing collection. For example, to aggregate sales data and store the results in a collection named 'salesSummary', you would use: db.sales.aggregate([{ $group: { _id: '$productId', totalSales: { $sum: '$amount' } } }, { $out: 'salesSummary' }]). The $out operator is particularly useful for materializing the results of complex aggregations, enabling further analysis or reporting on the output data. It is essential for scenarios where the aggregation results need to be persisted for future use.
