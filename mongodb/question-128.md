## question : What is MongoDB's $split operator?

## answer: $split is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that splits a string into an array of substrings based on a specified delimiter. It is particularly useful when you need to break down a string into individual components, such as splitting a full name into first and last names. For example, to split an email address into the username and domain parts, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { emailParts: { $split: ['$email', '@'] } } }]). The $split operator is essential for scenarios where you need to deconstruct strings into their component parts for further analysis or processing within MongoDB.
