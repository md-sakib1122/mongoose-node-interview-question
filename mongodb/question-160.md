## question : What is MongoDB's $isString operator?

## answer: $isString is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that checks if a specified value is a string. It returns a boolean result indicating whether the value is a string. This operator is useful for validating data types or filtering documents based on string fields. For example, to check if the 'name' field is a string, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { isString: { $isString: '$name' } } }]). The $isString operator is particularly useful in scenarios where data type consistency is important, such as in data validation, processing, or ensuring that operations are performed on string fields.
