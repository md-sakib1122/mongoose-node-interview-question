## question : What is MongoDB's $function operator?

## answer: $function is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that allows you to define custom JavaScript functions within your aggregation pipeline. This operator is useful when you need to perform complex calculations or transformations that are not directly supported by standard MongoDB operators. For example, to create a custom function that calculates the square of a number, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { squareValue: { $function: { body: function(x) { return x * x; }, args: ['$value'], lang: 'js' } } } }]). The $function operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to extend MongoDB's capabilities with custom logic, providing flexibility and power in your data processing workflows.
