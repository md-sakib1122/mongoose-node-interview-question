## question : What is MongoDB's $degreesToRadians operator?

## answer: $degreesToRadians is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that converts an angle from degrees to radians. This operator is useful when performing trigonometric calculations that require angle measurements in radians rather than degrees. For example, to convert an 'angle' field from degrees to radians, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { radians: { $degreesToRadians: '$angle' } } }]). The $degreesToRadians operator is essential in scenarios where you need to work with angles in a format suitable for trigonometric functions, particularly in fields like geometry, physics, and engineering.
