## question : What is MongoDB's $lookup operator?

## answer: $lookup is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that performs a left outer join with another collection to retrieve related documents. It is useful for combining data from different collections based on a common field. For example, to join a 'users' collection with an 'orders' collection on 'userId', you would use: db.users.aggregate([{ $lookup: { from: 'orders', localField: '_id', foreignField: 'userId', as: 'userOrders' } }]). The $lookup operator is particularly useful for enriching documents with related data from other collections, enabling more complex queries and aggregations.
