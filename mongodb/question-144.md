## question : What is MongoDB's $pow operator?

## answer: $pow is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that raises a number to a specified exponent, essentially performing a power calculation. It is commonly used in scenarios that involve exponential growth, compound interest calculations, or any mathematical operation where one number is raised to the power of another. For example, to calculate the 'value' field raised to the power of 3, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { powValue: { $pow: ['$value', 3] } } }]). The $pow operator is particularly useful for financial calculations, physics simulations, and other situations requiring exponentiation.
