## question : What is MongoDB's $replaceAll operator?

## answer: $replaceAll is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that replaces all instances of a substring within a string with a specified replacement string. It is useful when you need to perform a global replacement of text within a string field. For example, to replace all instances of 'foo' with 'bar' in a 'description' field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { updatedDescription: { $replaceAll: { input: '$description', find: 'foo', replacement: 'bar' } } } }]). The $replaceAll operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to standardize or clean up text data by replacing multiple occurrences of a substring within a string.
