## question : What is MongoDB's $dateSubtract operator?

## answer: $dateSubtract is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that subtracts a specified amount of time from a date, returning the new date. It is useful for calculating past dates based on a given date, such as subtracting days, months, or years. For example, to subtract 7 days from a 'createdAt' date field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { pastDate: { $dateSubtract: { startDate: '$createdAt', unit: 'day', amount: 7 } } } }]). The $dateSubtract operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to determine start dates, historical events, or calculate how much time has passed since a specific date.
