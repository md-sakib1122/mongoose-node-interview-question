## question : What is MongoDB's $arrayLength operator?

## answer: $arrayLength is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that returns the number of elements in an array. This operator is useful when you need to determine the size of an array or perform operations based on the number of elements it contains. For example, to get the length of an array field 'items', you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { itemCount: { $size: '$items' } } }]). The $size operator (previously known as $arrayLength) is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to assess the quantity of items in an array for filtering, grouping, or conditional operations.
