## question : What is MongoDB's $ifNull operator?

## answer: $ifNull is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that returns a specified value if a field is null or does not exist, otherwise, it returns the field's value. This operator is useful for handling missing or null values in a document. For example, to return 'N/A' if a field 'description' is null or missing, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { desc: { $ifNull: ['$description', 'N/A'] } } }]). The $ifNull operator is particularly useful in scenarios where default values are needed to handle cases of missing or incomplete data, ensuring robustness in data processing.
