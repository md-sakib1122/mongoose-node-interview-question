## question : What is MongoDB's $dateFromString operator?

## answer: $dateFromString is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that converts a string representation of a date into a Date object. This is useful when date information is stored as strings and needs to be converted for date-based operations. For example, to convert a 'dateString' field into a Date object, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { dateField: { $dateFromString: { dateString: '$dateString' } } } }]). The $dateFromString operator is particularly useful when dealing with date data that is stored in text format and requires conversion for accurate querying and aggregation.
