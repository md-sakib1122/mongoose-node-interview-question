## question : What is MongoDB's $dateToString operator?

## answer: $dateToString is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that formats a Date object into a string representation. This is useful for converting date and time fields into a readable format for display or reporting. For example, to format a 'createdAt' date field as 'YYYY-MM-DD', you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { formattedDate: { $dateToString: { format: '%Y-%m-%d', date: '$createdAt' } } } }]). The $dateToString operator is particularly useful when you need to present date and time information in a specific format or when generating reports.
