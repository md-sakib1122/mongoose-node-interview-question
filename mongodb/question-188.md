## question : What is MongoDB's $dateTrunc operator?

## answer: $dateTrunc is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that truncates a date to the specified unit (e.g., year, month, day, hour) based on the specified timezone. It is useful for normalizing dates to a lower precision, such as truncating timestamps to the nearest day or hour for analysis. For example, to truncate a 'createdAt' date field to the nearest day, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { truncatedDate: { $dateTrunc: { date: '$createdAt', unit: 'day' } } } }]). The $dateTrunc operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to simplify or group dates for reporting, analysis, or aggregating time-based data by a specific unit.
