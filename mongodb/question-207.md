## question : What is MongoDB's $let operator?

## answer: $let is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that allows you to define variables within an expression and use them in subsequent operations. This operator is useful when you need to simplify complex expressions by breaking them down into reusable components. For example, to calculate the final price after applying a discount, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { finalPrice: { $let: { vars: { discount: { $multiply: ['$price', 0.1] } }, in: { $subtract: ['$price', '$$discount'] } } } } }]). The $let operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to reuse intermediate results or simplify complex calculations within your aggregation pipeline.
