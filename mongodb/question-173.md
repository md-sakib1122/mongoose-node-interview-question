## question : What is MongoDB's $dayOfYear operator?

## answer: $dayOfYear is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that extracts the day of the year from a date field, returning an integer between 1 and 366. This operator is useful for grouping or filtering documents by the day of the year. For example, to extract the day of the year from a 'createdAt' date field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { dayOfYear: { $dayOfYear: '$createdAt' } } }]). The $dayOfYear operator is particularly useful in scenarios involving time-based analysis, such as identifying trends based on the day of the year, or when working with time series data that requires this level of granularity.
