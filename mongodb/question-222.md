## question : What is MongoDB's $merge operator?

## answer: $merge is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that allows you to output the results of an aggregation pipeline into a specified collection. It can be used to either insert new documents, update existing documents, or upsert documents based on matching criteria. For example, to merge aggregation results into a collection called 'results', you would use: db.collection.aggregate([...pipeline...], { $merge: 'results' }). The $merge operator is useful for persisting the results of aggregation operations, enabling you to store intermediate or final results in a collection for further analysis or reporting.
