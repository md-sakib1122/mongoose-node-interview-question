## question : What is MongoDB's $concat operator?

## answer: $concat is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework used to concatenate two or more strings into a single string. It is commonly used to combine values from multiple fields or to append additional text to a string. For example, to concatenate a user's first and last names into a full name, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { fullName: { $concat: ['$firstName', ' ', '$lastName'] } } }]). The $concat operator is essential for scenarios where string manipulation is required, allowing you to build and format text values dynamically within MongoDB queries.
