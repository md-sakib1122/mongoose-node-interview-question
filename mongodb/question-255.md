## question : What is MongoDB's $mergeObjects operator?

## answer: $mergeObjects is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that merges multiple documents into a single document. If there are overlapping fields, values from later documents override those from earlier documents. For example, to merge fields from 'doc1' and 'doc2', you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { merged: { $mergeObjects: ['$doc1', '$doc2'] } } }]). The $mergeObjects operator is useful for combining documents with overlapping fields into a unified document, often used for data enrichment and aggregation.
