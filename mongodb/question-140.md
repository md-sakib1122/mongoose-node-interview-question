## question : What is MongoDB's $exp operator?

## answer: $exp is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that calculates the exponent of a number, specifically the constant e (Euler's number, approximately 2.718) raised to the power of the specified value. This operator is useful in scenarios involving exponential growth calculations, scientific computations, or when dealing with logarithmic transformations. For example, to calculate e raised to the power of the 'value' field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { expValue: { $exp: '$value' } } }]). The $exp operator is particularly useful in mathematical and financial calculations where exponential functions are required.
