## question : What is MongoDB's $mergeObjects operator?

## answer: $mergeObjects is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework used to merge multiple documents or subdocuments into a single document. It combines the fields from two or more documents, with fields from later documents overwriting those from earlier ones if there are conflicts. For example, to merge two fields 'details1' and 'details2' into a single document, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { mergedDetails: { $mergeObjects: ['$details1', '$details2'] } } }]). $mergeObjects is particularly useful for combining data from multiple sources within a document, simplifying data structures, and ensuring that the final document includes all relevant information.
