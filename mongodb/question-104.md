## question : What is MongoDB's $slice operator?

## answer: $slice is an operator in MongoDB used to limit the number of elements in an array field returned in a query. This operator is commonly used to retrieve a subset of elements from an array, such as the first few items or the last few items. For example, to get the first 3 comments from a 'comments' array, you would use: db.posts.find({}, { comments: { $slice: 3 } }). $slice can also be used in update operations in conjunction with $push to maintain a capped list within a document. It is particularly useful in scenarios where only a portion of an array is needed, improving query efficiency by reducing the amount of data returned.
