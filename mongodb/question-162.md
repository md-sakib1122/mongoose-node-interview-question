## question : What is MongoDB's $toBool operator?

## answer: $toBool is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that converts a specified value to a boolean. It is useful when you need to ensure that a value is interpreted as either true or false, particularly when dealing with non-boolean data types. For example, to convert the 'active' field to a boolean, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { isActive: { $toBool: '$active' } } }]). The $toBool operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to standardize values for logical operations, ensuring that non-boolean inputs are correctly interpreted in boolean contexts.
