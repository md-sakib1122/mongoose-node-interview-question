## question : What is the use of $all in MongoDB?

## answer: $all is an operator in MongoDB used to match documents where an array field contains all the elements specified in the query. This operator is particularly useful when you need to ensure that an array field includes multiple specific values, regardless of their order or other elements in the array. For example, if you have a collection of documents representing users, and each document has an 'interests' array, you might want to find all users who are interested in both 'hiking' and 'photography'. You can achieve this using the $all operator: db.users.find({ interests: { $all: ['hiking', 'photography'] } }). This query returns all documents where the 'interests' array contains both 'hiking' and 'photography', regardless of whether other interests are also listed. The $all operator is similar to $in but differs in that $in matches any of the specified values, while $all requires that all specified values be present. This makes $all a powerful tool when you need to enforce the presence of multiple specific elements within an array. It is commonly used in scenarios such as filtering by multiple tags, categories, or attributes within an array field.
