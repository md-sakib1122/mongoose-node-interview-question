## question : What is the use of $push in MongoDB?

## answer: $push is an operator in MongoDB used in update operations to add elements to an array field within a document. If the array field does not exist, $push will create it and add the specified element as the first item in the array. This operator is useful for maintaining lists, such as adding items to a user's shopping cart, appending log entries, or tracking changes over time. For example, to add a new tag to an array of tags in a document, you would use: db.posts.updateOne({ _id: postId }, { $push: { tags: 'newTag' } }). This command adds 'newTag' to the 'tags' array field of the specified document. The $push operator also supports adding multiple elements to an array at once by passing an array as the value. Additionally, $push can be combined with the $each modifier to push multiple values and with $sort to maintain a sorted array. For example: db.users.updateOne({ _id: userId }, { $push: { scores: { $each: [90, 85], $sort: -1 } } }) adds the scores to the 'scores' array and sorts the array in descending order. The $push operator is a powerful tool for managing arrays in MongoDB documents, allowing for flexible and efficient updates.
