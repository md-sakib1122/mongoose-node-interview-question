## question : What is MongoDB's $round operator?

## answer: $round is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that rounds a numeric value to a specified number of decimal places. It is useful when you need to standardize the precision of numerical data. For example, to round a 'price' field to two decimal places, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { roundedPrice: { $round: ['$price', 2] } } }]). The $round operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to ensure consistency in numerical precision, such as financial calculations or data reporting.
