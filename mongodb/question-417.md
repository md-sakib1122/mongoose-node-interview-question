## question : How do you use the `$lookup` operator in Mongoose?

## answer: The `$lookup` operator in Mongoose is used in aggregation pipelines to perform a left outer join between two collections. For example: `User.aggregate([{ $lookup: { from: 'orders', localField: '_id', foreignField: 'userId', as: 'orders' } }]);`
