## question : What is MongoDB's $toDecimal operator?

## answer: $toDecimal is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that converts a specified value to a decimal (128-bit high precision floating-point number). This operator is useful when you need to ensure that a value is in decimal format for high-precision calculations, such as financial operations. For example, to convert a string field 'price' to a decimal, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { priceDecimal: { $toDecimal: '$price' } } }]). The $toDecimal operator is particularly useful in scenarios where accuracy and precision are critical, ensuring that inputs are correctly interpreted as decimal values for reliable calculations.
