## question : What is MongoDB's $strcasecmp operator?

## answer: $strcasecmp is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework used to perform a case-insensitive comparison of two strings. It returns an integer indicating whether the first string is less than, equal to, or greater than the second string. For example, to compare two fields 'name1' and 'name2' case-insensitively, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { comparisonResult: { $strcasecmp: ['$name1', '$name2'] } } }]). The $strcasecmp operator is particularly useful for sorting, filtering, or comparing strings in a way that ignores case differences, ensuring that comparisons are consistent regardless of letter casing.
