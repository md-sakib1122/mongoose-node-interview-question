## question : What is MongoDB's $binarySize operator?

## answer: $binarySize is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that returns the size of a binary data field in bytes. It is useful when you need to determine the size of binary data stored in a document, such as images, files, or any binary content. For example, to get the size of a 'fileData' field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { fileSize: { $binarySize: '$fileData' } } }]). The $binarySize operator is essential in scenarios where you need to manage or analyze the storage requirements of binary data, ensuring that your application handles data efficiently.
