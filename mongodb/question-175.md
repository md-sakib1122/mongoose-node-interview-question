## question : What is MongoDB's $dayOfWeek operator?

## answer: $dayOfWeek is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that extracts the day of the week from a date field, returning an integer between 1 (Sunday) and 7 (Saturday). This operator is useful for grouping or filtering documents by the day of the week. For example, to extract the day of the week from a 'createdAt' date field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { dayOfWeek: { $dayOfWeek: '$createdAt' } } }]). The $dayOfWeek operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to analyze data based on the specific day of the week, such as in weekly sales reports, identifying patterns in daily traffic, or when studying behaviors that vary by day of the week.
