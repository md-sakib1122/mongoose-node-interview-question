## question : What is MongoDB's $addFields operator?

## answer: $addFields is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework used to add new fields to documents or modify existing fields. It allows you to create or update fields based on expressions, making it useful for enriching data during aggregation. For example, to add a new field 'totalPrice' that multiplies 'quantity' by 'price', you would use: db.orders.aggregate([{ $addFields: { totalPrice: { $multiply: ['$quantity', '$price'] } } }]). $addFields is particularly helpful when you need to dynamically create new fields based on the results of calculations or other field manipulations within the pipeline. It enhances the flexibility of MongoDB's aggregation process, allowing you to derive additional insights from your data.
