## question : What is MongoDB's $add operator?

## answer: $add is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that performs addition on two or more numbers. This operator can also be used to perform arithmetic operations on other numerical values, such as dates. For example, to add two numbers 'a' and 'b', you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { sum: { $add: ['$a', '$b'] } } }]). The $add operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to perform mathematical calculations or aggregate numerical data within your documents.
