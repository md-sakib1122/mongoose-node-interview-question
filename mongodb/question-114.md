## question : What is MongoDB's $mod operator?

## answer: $mod is an operator in MongoDB that performs a modulo operation on the value of a field. It is used to return the remainder of a division operation, making it useful for filtering documents based on the result of this operation. For example, to find all documents where the 'count' field is an even number, you would use: db.collection.find({ count: { $mod: [2, 0] } }). This query filters documents where 'count' modulo 2 equals 0. The $mod operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to group or filter data based on specific intervals or cyclic patterns.
