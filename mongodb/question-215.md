## question : What is MongoDB's $reverseArray operator?

## answer: $reverseArray is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that reverses the order of elements in an array. This operator is useful when you need to change the sequence of elements within an array. For example, to reverse the elements of an array 'items', you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { reversedItems: { $reverseArray: '$items' } } }]). The $reverseArray operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to process arrays in reverse order, such as when performing operations that depend on the last elements first or when reordering data for presentation purposes.
