## question : What is MongoDB's $gte operator?

## answer: $gte is a comparison operator in MongoDB that matches documents where the value of a specified field is greater than or equal to a given value. It is used in queries to filter documents based on conditions where a field must meet or exceed a specific threshold. For example, to find all documents where the 'age' field is greater than or equal to 30, you would use: db.collection.find({ age: { $gte: 30 } }). The $gte operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to include documents that meet a minimum value requirement, ensuring that all relevant records that are equal to or above a certain value are returned in the query results.
