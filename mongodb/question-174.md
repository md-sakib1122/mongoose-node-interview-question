## question : What is MongoDB's $dayOfMonth operator?

## answer: $dayOfMonth is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that extracts the day of the month from a date field, returning an integer between 1 and 31. This operator is useful for grouping or filtering documents by the day of the month. For example, to extract the day of the month from a 'createdAt' date field, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { dayOfMonth: { $dayOfMonth: '$createdAt' } } }]). The $dayOfMonth operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to analyze data based on the specific day of the month, such as in billing cycles, monthly reports, or when examining daily patterns within a month.
