## question : What is MongoDB's $gt operator?

## answer: $gt is a comparison operator in MongoDB that matches documents where the value of a specified field is greater than a given value. It is commonly used in queries to filter documents based on a condition where a field must be larger than a specific threshold. For example, to find all documents where the 'age' field is greater than 30, you would use: db.collection.find({ age: { $gt: 30 } }). The $gt operator is essential for scenarios where you need to filter results based on numeric or date values, ensuring that only documents meeting the 'greater than' criteria are returned.
