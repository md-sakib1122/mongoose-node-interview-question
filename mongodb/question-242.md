## question : What is MongoDB's $toDouble operator?

## answer: $toDouble is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that converts a value to a double (floating-point number). This is useful for performing decimal arithmetic or when a field's data type needs to be adjusted for precision. For example, to convert a field 'amount' to a double, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { amountDouble: { $toDouble: '$amount' } } }]). The $toDouble operator is particularly useful when dealing with fields that store numeric data as strings or integers and require floating-point precision for calculations.
