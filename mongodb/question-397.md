## question : How do you handle relationships between documents in Mongoose?

## answer: Relationships between documents in Mongoose are handled through referencing (using `ObjectId` and `ref`) or embedding (storing subdocuments within a document). `populate()` is commonly used to retrieve referenced documents.
