## question : What is MongoDB's $arrayToObject operator?

## answer: $arrayToObject is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that converts an array of key-value pairs into a single document (object). It is particularly useful when working with arrays that need to be transformed into a more traditional document structure. For example, if you have an array of key-value pairs, you can convert it into an object using: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { obj: { $arrayToObject: '$keyValueArray' } } }]). The $arrayToObject operator simplifies working with data structures by allowing you to convert arrays into objects for easier access and manipulation within your MongoDB queries.
