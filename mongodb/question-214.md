## question : What is MongoDB's $range operator?

## answer: $range is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that generates an array of numbers within a specified range. It is useful when you need to create arrays with sequential values. For example, to generate an array of numbers from 0 to 9, you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { rangeArray: { $range: [0, 10] } } }]). The $range operator is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to generate sequences, such as creating lists of page numbers, generating time intervals, or setting up loops within an aggregation pipeline.
