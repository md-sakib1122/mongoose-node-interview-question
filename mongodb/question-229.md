## question : What is MongoDB's $currentDate operator?

## answer: $currentDate is an operator in MongoDB used to set the value of a field to the current date and time. This operator can be used in update operations to automatically assign the current date to a field. For example, to update the 'lastModified' field to the current date, you would use: db.collection.updateMany({}, { $currentDate: { lastModified: true } }). The $currentDate operator is particularly useful for tracking document creation or modification times, logging events, or implementing time-based functionality.
