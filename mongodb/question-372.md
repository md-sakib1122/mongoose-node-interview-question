## question : How do you define a schema in Mongoose?

## answer: In Mongoose, you define a schema using the `mongoose.Schema` class. A schema defines the structure of the documents within a collection, including fields, their types, and validation requirements. For example: `const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({ name: String, age: Number, email: String });`
