## question : What is MongoDB's $reduce operator?

## answer: $reduce is an operator in MongoDB's Aggregation Framework that applies an expression to each element in an array, accumulating the results into a single value. It is useful for operations where you need to aggregate or summarize array data. For example, to calculate the sum of all elements in an array 'values', you would use: db.collection.aggregate([{ $project: { total: { $reduce: { input: '$values', initialValue: 0, in: { $add: ['$$value', '$$this'] } } } } }]). The $reduce operator is particularly useful for scenarios where you need to perform cumulative operations on arrays, such as summing numbers, concatenating strings, or building complex structures from array elements.
