## question : What is MongoDB's $push operator?

## answer: $push is an operator in MongoDB used in update operations to add elements to an array field within a document. If the array field does not exist, $push will create it and add the specified element as the first item in the array. This operator is useful for maintaining lists, such as adding items to a user's shopping cart, appending log entries, or tracking changes over time. For example, to add a new tag to an array of tags in a document, you would use: db.posts.updateOne({ _id: postId }, { $push: { tags: 'newTag' } }). The $push operator also supports adding multiple elements to an array at once by passing an array as the value.
