## question : What is the difference between `fs.readFile()` and `fs.createReadStream()` in Node.js?

## answer: `fs.readFile()` reads the entire contents of a file into memory before returning it, while `fs.createReadStream()` reads the file in chunks, making it more memory-efficient for large files.
